Fix Inventory IAM Role Cloudformation Templates

## Overview

These templates are used to create an AWS IAM role that has the exact permissions Fix Inventory requires to run. The role template is autogenerated whenever the AWS plugin is updated.

The best starting point is our [How to Roll Out Resoto AWS Permissions with CloudFormation](https://inventory.fix.security/docs/how-to-guides/configuration/roll-out-fixinventory-aws-permissions-with-cloudformation) how to guide.

If you are only interested in the raw template file:

The code that generates the role as well as the role template, lives in [the AWS Fix Inventory plugin project](https://github.com/someengineering/fixinventory/tree/main/plugins/aws/tools/awspolicygen).
